    "#### Basic Data Exploration\n",
    "**Explanation:** In cell [1], I began by loading and briefly examining the dataset. First, I imported the pandas library, a standard tool in Python for data handling and manipulation. I then read the file titled \"student_lifestyle_dataset(psych).csv\" into a pandas DataFrame named df, and created a duplicate DataFrame to use for subsequent analysis. Using the .shape function, I confirmed that the dataset contains 2,000 rows and 9 columns. In this context, the rows represent the individual participants, while the columns correspond to the various topics or variables being examined. Lastly, as directed, I utilized the *.head()* and *.tail()* functions to display the first and last five entries of the dataset, allowing for an initial review of the data structure and content.\n",

    "**Explanation:** The summary statistics provide insights into the central tendency, spread, and range of the numerical values within the dataset. My particular summary tells me that the average study hours(~7.48) and the average sleep hours(7.50) are somewhat high. These results suggest that the typical student in this sample has a relatively focused and well-rested lifestyle. The average GPA(7.78) is also moderately high. The average extracurricular time(1.99 hours) is low, and the average social time (2.70 hours) is moderate, which shows that students spend less time on these activities compared to studying or sleeping.

Instead of having to look at the 4 different columns, there is now a single column that represents the daily time spent outside of sleeping.

    "**Explanation:** By creating these two filters, researchers can look at the two key variables: Stress Levels and Grades. I decided to filter for high stress levels, so that I am able to see the particpants who have rated themselves as being very stressed. From this filter, I can look at each high-stress participant's corresponding measures of their daily life. I can also see trends in the data. For example, with the high stress filter, I can see from the first five rows that these participants all have a higher number of total activity hours as well as high GPAs. My second filter was looking at individuals with lower GPAs to see if a lower GPA can be an indicator of lower study hours. Based on the first five rows displayed under this filter, these five participants do have a lower number of study hours when you compare them to students with higher GPAs."

    "### Summary And Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "**Initial Observations:** There were a lot of interesting aspects of this dataset. The most interesting or even significant finding is that when you add the mean of the Total Activity Hours to the mean of sleep hours, you get exactly 24 hours. However, this pattern does not hold for all quartiles. This indicates that this dataset was collected under somewhat strict constraints, as the hours vary. The second observation is that this population is very \"busy\". The mean for Study hours is high at 7.5 hours, with a minimum being only 5 hours. Furthermore, the mean for the Physical  Activity hours is about 4.3 hours. A combined average of nearly 12 hours of only studying and physical activity suggests this is a mixture of high-performing or high-activity groups of students. My final observation is that there could be potential outliers in physical activity. This is because the maximum value for physical activity is 13 hours. This is a strong outlier as the 75th percentile is only 6.1 hours. This one data point could skew the mean. Overall, the dataset was very insightful in understanding the correlation between how students spend their time and its impact on their grades."
